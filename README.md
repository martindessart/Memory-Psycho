Here is one of some exercises I've been practicing for the Udacity Nanodegree Front-End Web Developer 6 month program.

Examples here: https://codepen.io/momomartin/

Check some cool games like "Dark-Arcade-Game" and "Memory-Psycho" or learn what's happening in Iceland's volcanoes with "Ice-Rock-Map", one nice animal mimicry trick with "Animal Trading Card" or learn a bit about myself with my "portfolio"

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
